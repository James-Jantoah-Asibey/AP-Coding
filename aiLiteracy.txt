Things that ai cant do are: 1) they can connect with us emotionally beause they arent huamn.
You can program an ai to talk or give advise but they won't respond with the senerity as a human would.
 2) ai cant be as free as us humans, they are programmed to follow orders so even if you projram them 
 to be free theyll still technacially follow your order. 3) ai cant fall in love because 
 they are artificail intelligence, they dont need to find a mate becausetey cant experiance love.

Ai is made to make our lives easier, they are there to remind us of inportant thimgs we may forget.
 They help us clean the house and are there to do dangerous things that us humans can't do or can 
 but wont because they could die. It could also be a bad thing bc we are gettingto dependant on it 
 some people have reminders on their phones to remind them for there families birthdays and wihtout
 it they dont reminber, its scary bc if Ai dissapeared us humans would be in parrel due to the fact
 that we've become lazy

 Scheeols should integrate Ai in their class rooms by usin it to help the students who need
 extra help. The students can ask the ai questions withot getting the answers but a detailed and 
 simple explaination of what the answer is. Teachers could also use Ai to catch students who use Ai for
 their homework or classwork. The teachers can scan the students response and ask it if the studnet 
 used Ai to cheat.
